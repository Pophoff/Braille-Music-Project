### Braille-Music-Project

_Paul Ophoff and Nathanael Wilcox_

# Project that turns sheet music file into printable braille music file

---

Currently to run main.py you need to do a few things

- pip install partitura
- pip install typing_extensions (partitura needs it)
- Download Musescore Studio (Free download)

- pip install cadquery
  This will not work on Python versions newer than 3.12 because of a library cadquery uses
